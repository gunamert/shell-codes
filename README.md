# shell-codes


1.	Easy.sh
	This is a good script but this is too easy. It open 2 websites and 1 application. At the beginning of the script user could enter which website or application that is going to be used by user and script shell would be just run this website or application.
2.	Medium.sh
	In this script shell, it is a simple opening screen. Coder can improve the starting screen where the user at the same time and adding what time is in users currently location etc.

3.	Hard.sh
	This is a perfect shell script. But maybe adding a weather   web site and giving a correct degree and also adding the other temperatures (Fahrenheit etc.) would be useful script.
